      <description>GIT 1.Git is the most commonly used version control system.
2.Git tracks the changes you make to files
  you have a record of what has been done, can revert to specific versions should you ever need to, it also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.   3.The commands used to keep the track of changes, help in creating new repository and all other functions which you could do on GitHub now can be done on terminal.</description>

      <description>MARKDOWN   Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. It was created back in 2004 by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as an easy way for non-coders to write in a format that could be easily converted into HTML. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.</description>
